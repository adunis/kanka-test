Il Patron non è interessato solo alla conquista di Cormyr - questo è solo un diversivo. Il suo vero obiettivo è la nostra Somma Sacerdotessa di Selûne, custode della conoscenza della Scala Celeste. Ho studiato gli eventi di dieci anni fa, quando il Ragno Nero trovò il primo globo Netherese, e ora tutto ha un senso. Il Patron vuole ascendere alla divinità, e per farlo ha bisogno sia dei globi che della conoscenza della Scala.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Ho bisogno che voi proteggiate la capitale mentre io viaggio verso le antiche rovine dove il primo globo fu trovato. Sento che c'è una connessione tra i globi e la Scala Celeste stessa - forse i Netherese tentarono di replicare il suo potere divino. Ma dovete essere vigili: il Patron non manderà solo un esercito di non morti. I suoi agenti più letali si infiltreranno nella città cercando di raggiungere il tempio di Selûne.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Il tempo stringe, e il destino di più di un regno è in bilico. La diplomazia ha il suo posto, ma ora è il momento dell'azione. Che la luce di Selûne ci guidi.\"<br><br>Grazia earned her epithet \"The Friendly\" through centuries of careful diplomacy, though some cynics note that her warm smile and disarming manner mask an exceptionally shrewd political mind. She chose her current form - that of a statuesque black woman adorned in flowing golden garments - specifically to project both authority and approachability, standing out among the more traditionally martial members of the Vizier's Council. While she genuinely believes in building bridges between nations, she's also keenly aware that Cormyr's survival depends on maintaining a complex web of alliances.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Those who work closely with her appreciate her patient willingness to listen and mediate disputes, making her a natural choice for the delicate mission to Zorthadlun. However, her tendency to seek compromise has earned her critics among Cormyr's hardliners, who deride her as overly cautious and accuse her of giving too much ground in negotiations. Her extensive research into ancient threats has recently yielded crucial insights - particularly regarding the events from a decade ago involving the Black Spider and the first Netherese globe.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Through careful study of historical records and witness accounts, Grazia has pieced together how the Black Spider's discovery of the first Netherese globe initially drew the Patron's attention to our realm. The subsequent loss of the globe to the adventurers Grogo, Bungo, Dudo, and Hene only intensified the ancient aboleth's interest. She believes understanding the globe's original location and purpose is crucial - if she can trace its origins and the reason for its creation, the very artifacts that drew the Patron's attention might be turned against it. This research has become something of an obsession for her, leading her to spend countless hours poring over ancient texts and interviewing anyone who might have knowledge of early Netherese artifice.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Her scholarly pursuit of this knowledge reveals another facet of her character - while she maintains the diplomatic face needed for her position, she's also a determined investigator who believes that understanding the past is key to securing the future. She's been known to disappear for weeks into forgotten libraries or ancient ruins, following leads about the globes' origins, much to the Council's occasional frustration. Yet even in this academic pursuit, her diplomatic skills serve her well - she's built a network of scholars, adventurers, and even reformed drow who share information about Netherese artifacts and the Black Spider's activities.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">In the current crisis with the Puppeteer's forces, her understanding of both current politics and ancient history makes her uniquely valuable. She suspects that finding the original location of the first globe could reveal a weakness in the Patron's plans - a theory she hopes to confirm through collaboration with the githzerai, who have their own extensive records of battling aboleths through the ages.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><br><br>Grazia's diplomatic mission has taken on even greater urgency with the revelation of the Patron's true objective: the High Priestess of Selûne, keeper of the sacred knowledge regarding the Heavenly Staircase's location. The angel knows that if the Patron succeeds in capturing the High Priestess and accessing the Staircase, the consequences would be catastrophic - an aboleth ascending to godhood would fundamentally destabilize the divine order that helps maintain peace across the planes.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">This presents Grazia with a complex strategic dilemma. Her research into the Netherese globes cannot wait - she believes understanding their origin could provide the key to defeating the Patron - but she also cannot leave Cormyr's capital defenseless. The undead armies approaching from Amn are merely a diversion, she suspects, meant to thin out the city's defenses while the Patron's more specialized agents attempt to infiltrate the Temple of Selûne.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">In private moments, Grazia has confided to close allies that she sees troubling parallels between the Netherese globes and the Heavenly Staircase - both seem to be mechanisms for manipulating divine energy, though operating on vastly different scales. She theorizes that the ancient Netherese may have studied the Staircase itself when creating the globes, attempting to replicate its ability to bridge the gap between mortal and divine realms.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The situation has forced her to show a side of her personality rarely seen in diplomatic circles - that of a decisive military commander. She's quietly recruiting both traditional allies and unconventional partners to help fortify the capital. Her centuries of relationship-building are proving valuable as she calls in favors from various quarters, though she's careful to maintain the appearance that Cormyr's defenses remain unchanged. She knows the Patron has spies everywhere and hopes to turn their expectations against them.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">What makes her particularly effective in this crisis is her ability to see the bigger picture - she understands that this isn't just about protecting a single priestess or artifact, but about preventing a fundamental shift in the balance of power between mortals and gods. Yet this same broad perspective sometimes makes her seem distant or overly calculating to those who don't know her well, especially when she has to make difficult decisions about allocating resources between immediate defense and long-term research.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Through careful study of previous invasions of Cormyr, she's also begun to suspect that the Patron's fixation on the Heavenly Staircase might be its greatest weakness. Like many ancient beings, it seems to have become obsessed with a single path to power, potentially blinding it to other vulnerabilities - vulnerabilities that might be exposed through proper understanding of the Netherese globes.</p><p></p>",

The slight tremor in her white wings betrays her growing unease:</em></p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">\"Miei cari amici, the signs are more dire than we initially conceived. The Puppeteer’s advance on Cormyr is a diversion, a calculated deception to mask his true aim: the capture of the High Priestess of Selûne, custodian of the knowledge of the Heavenly Staircase, which still shifts across the planes and remains one of the few uncorrupted paths towards the divine.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">\"For a decade, I have meticulously chronicled the events stemming from the Black Spider's ill-fated discovery in the ancient ruins near Wave Echo Cave,now known as Dr. Bu's Lab. The rise and fall of the Black Spider occurred before The Great Descent, when the gods led the Divine War against the Primordials and Old Gods. The discovery drew the Puppeteer's gaze, and that of other entities, to this shattered world. Only now do I truly understand the breadth of his ambition.”</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">“My friends, I ask that you bolster Cormyr’s defenses, for the undead legions from Amn, now twisted with abyssal energies leaking from The Great Descent, represent a fraction of the danger; the Puppeteer aims to seize the path to godhood itself. I must journey to these ruins – the nexus of where the aboleth's touch first stained our world – and unravel this ancient mystery. I believe the Netherese artifacts are the key.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">\"But remain vigilant. The Puppeteer will not only send his armies, but his most insidious agents - those whose steps weave through the shadows - into Suzail, seeking to infiltrate the Temple of Selûne. You must prepare. You must resist.\"</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">\"Time is fleeting, and the fate of more than Cormyr hangs in the balance. Though diplomacy remains a valuable tool, action is paramount. May Selûne’s light guide us.\"</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Grazia \"The Friendly\": Diplomat and Scholar</h2>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Grazia, an angel who earned her title through centuries of diplomacy, also conceals a keen political mind. Her chosen form – a statuesque black woman in golden robes – projects both authority and approachability, allowing her to bridge divides. While committed to building alliances, she is acutely aware of Cormyr's reliance on a complex web of relationships for survival in this post-Descent world.</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Her patience and mediation skills are valued, making her a natural choice for missions to treacherous lands like Zorthadlun. However, her pursuit of compromise is viewed as excessive caution by some, who accuse her of conceding too much in negotiations. Nonetheless, recent findings from her historical research have provided crucial insights into ancient threats and the Black Spider's discovery of the first Netherese globe before the Great Descent.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>The Netherese Connection and the Puppeteer's Goal</h2>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Through scholarly diligence, Grazia learned that the Black Spider's discovery initially drew the Puppeteer's attention to our realm. While the Black Spider's actions ultimately led to his demise at the hands of Hene and the loss of the globe to the adventurers Grogo, Bungo, Dudo, and Hene, the Puppeteer's interest remained undeterred. Grazia believes that understanding the globe's original location and purpose is critical: these same artifacts might hold the key to thwarting the Puppeteer's schemes, a theory she hopes to confirm through the githzerai, known for their history of battling aboleths.</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The revelation of the Puppeteer's true objective – the High Priestess of Selûne and the knowledge of the Heavenly Staircase – underscores the urgency of Grazia's mission. The Heavenly Staircase, once a vital conduit between the Prime and Divine planes, was corrupted during The Great Descent by the forces of the Old Gods, creating a path that allows the malevolent entities from the Reame Remoto to infect the Prime Material Plane. If the High Priestess falls, this knowledge could enable an aboleth to ascend to godhood, catastrophically destabilizing the divine order.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Strategic Imperatives and Scholarly Obsession</h2>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Grazia faces a strategic dilemma. Her research cannot be delayed, but neither can the capital be left undefended. She suspects that the approaching undead armies from Amn are a diversion. This has forced her to display a decisive military command, quietly recruiting allies and unconventional partners to bolster the city's defenses.\n      Her broad perspective, however, can make her seem distant to others, especially when resources must be allocated between immediate defense and long-term research.</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">She confided to allies that she sees parallels between the globes and the Staircase, both mechanisms for manipulating divine energy, and she suspects the Puppeteer's obsession with the Staircase might be its greatest weakness – a weakness she hopes to expose by understanding the globes. It's also worth noting that while The Black Spider was slain at Cragmaw keep by Hene, in the name of Tyr, recent reports indicate that a cult linked with the Netherese is preparing an artifact called The Lunar Scourge, designed to be lethal against werewolves.</p>\n      <p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">As Grazia prepares for her journey, plot hooks are emerging. The Rockseekers might possess a fragment of an Astral Map pointing to a location beyond the material plane, or Grazia might require the recovery of an object from the Sea of Fallen Stars. The path ahead is fraught with danger, but Grazia, \"The Friendly,\" stands ready, her mind a beacon of knowledge, her will a fortress against the encroaching darkness.</p>\n    </section>\n  </article>\n</main>",
