She chose her current form - that of a statuesque black woman adorned in flowing golden garments - specifically to project both authority and approachability, standing out among the more traditionally martial members of the Vizier's Council. While she genuinely believes in building bridges between nations, she's also keenly aware that Cormyr's survival depends on maintaining a complex web of alliances.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Those who work closely with her appreciate her patient willingness to listen and mediate disputes, making her a natural choice for the delicate mission to Zorthadlun. However, her tendency to seek compromise has earned her critics among Cormyr's hardliners, who deride her as overly cautious and accuse her of giving too much ground in negotiations. Her extensive research into ancient threats has recently yielded crucial insights - particularly regarding the events from a decade ago involving the Black Spider and the first Netherese globe.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Through careful study of historical records and witness accounts, Grazia has pieced together how the Black Spider's discovery of the first Netherese globe initially drew the Patron's attention to our realm. The subsequent loss of the globe to the adventurers Grogo, Bungo, Dudo, and Hene only intensified the ancient aboleth's interest. She believes understanding the globe's original location and purpose is crucial - if she can trace its origins and the reason for its creation, the very artifacts that drew the Patron's attention might be turned against it. This research has become something of an obsession for her, leading her to spend countless hours poring over ancient texts and interviewing anyone who might have knowledge of early Netherese artifice.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Her scholarly pursuit of this knowledge reveals another facet of her character - while she maintains the diplomatic face needed for her position, she's also a determined investigator who believes that understanding the past is key to securing the future. She's been known to disappear for weeks into forgotten libraries or ancient ruins, following leads about the globes' origins, much to the Council's occasional frustration. Yet even in this academic pursuit, her diplomatic skills serve her well - she's built a network of scholars, adventurers, and even reformed drow who share information about Netherese artifacts and the Black Spider's activities.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">In the current crisis with the Puppeteer's forces, her understanding of both current politics and ancient history makes her uniquely valuable. She suspects that finding the original location of the first globe could reveal a weakness in the Patron's plans - a theory she hopes to confirm through collaboration with the githzerai, who have their own extensive records of battling aboleths through the ages.</p><p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><br><br>Grazia's diplomatic mission has taken on even greater urgency with the revelation of the Patron's true objective: the High Priestess of Selûne, keeper of the sacred knowledge regarding the Heavenly Staircase's location. The angel knows that if the Patron succeeds in capturing the High Priestess and accessing the Staircase, the consequences would be catastrophic - an aboleth ascending to godhood would fundamentally destabilize the divine order that helps maintain peace across the planes.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">This presents Grazia with a complex strategic dilemma. Her research into the Netherese globes cannot wait - she believes understanding their origin could provide the key to defeating the Patron - but she also cannot leave Cormyr's capital defenseless. The undead armies approaching from Amn are merely a diversion, she suspects, meant to thin out the city's defenses while the Patron's more specialized agents attempt to infiltrate the Temple of Selûne.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">In private moments, Grazia has confided to close allies that she sees troubling parallels between the Netherese globes and the Heavenly Staircase - both seem to be mechanisms for manipulating divine energy, though operating on vastly different scales. She theorizes that the ancient Netherese may have studied the Staircase itself when creating the globes, attempting to replicate its ability to bridge the gap between mortal and divine realms.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">The situation has forced her to show a side of her personality rarely seen in diplomatic circles - that of a decisive military commander. She's quietly recruiting both traditional allies and unconventional partners to help fortify the capital. Her centuries of relationship-building are proving valuable as she calls in favors from various quarters, though she's careful to maintain the appearance that Cormyr's defenses remain unchanged. She knows the Patron has spies everywhere and hopes to turn their expectations against them.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">What makes her particularly effective in this crisis is her ability to see the bigger picture - she understands that this isn't just about protecting a single priestess or artifact, but about preventing a fundamental shift in the balance of power between mortals and gods. Yet this same broad perspective sometimes makes her seem distant or overly calculating to those who don't know her well, especially when she has to make difficult decisions about allocating resources between immediate defense and long-term research.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Through careful study of previous invasions of Cormyr, she's also begun to suspect that the Patron's fixation on the Heavenly Staircase might be its greatest weakness. Like many ancient beings, it seems to have become obsessed with a single path to power, potentially blinding it to other vulnerabilities - vulnerabilities that might be exposed through proper understanding of the Netherese globes.</p><p></p>",
