    "entry": "<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Hene, a towering Aasimar Paladin, is a devout follower of Tyr, the god of sunlight, justice, and fairness.  Her unwavering commitment to justice is fueled by the brutal murder of her brother at the hands of the Red Sashes, a ruthless criminal organization operating out of Baldur's Gate. This event, occurring in the aftermath of the cataclysmic Great Descent—the apocalyptic war between the Old Gods and the other deities—has left an indelible mark on Hene, shaping her worldview and driving her quest for vengeance.  Following the Great Descent, Hene dedicated herself to hunting the Red Sashes. During her relentless pursuit, she eventually discovered their hidden lair in the sewers of Sshamath, where they were carrying amphorae filled with the imprisoned souls of Aasimar, including her brother's. After slaying the Black Spider, she recovered her brother's soul from an amphora and reincarnated it into her magical warhammer. While justice was served, Hene has decided to channel her grief into a mission to bring the Red Sashes to justice for their crimes against Aasimar.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Hene’s unwavering sense of justice and honor is tempered by a fiery temper and little patience for weakness or indecision. This often brings her into conflict with Grogo, a cleric of Ilmater, who preaches forgiveness and compassion, even for one’s enemies.  While initially resistant to Grogo’s teachings, Hene eventually learns the value of forgiveness, though she remains committed to punishing the guilty. This internal conflict between her righteous anger and the pursuit of forgiveness shapes Hene's character, leading her to evolve her understanding of justice in the post-Descent world. Hene has found some peace in incorporating her brother's soul into her magical warhammer Moonbane, allowing him to continue fighting by her side in the pursuit of justice. After the defeat of the Black Spider, Hene returned to Baldur's Gate where she continues her mission as a Paladin of Tyr by day and Slayer Moon, a vigilante, by night.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Hene's player chose a \"Giant\" character design, granting her the ability to utilize the <i>Enlarge/Reduce</i> spell. This allows Yilvina, the party's mage, to temporarily increase Hene's size to colossal proportions during combat, making her an even more formidable force on the battlefield. This strategic advantage is crucial in battles against powerful foes, where Hene's immense size and strength can overwhelm opponents.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Hene’s primary weapon is Moonbane, a magical warhammer forged by the party in the Wave Echo Cave. Originally created to be lethal against lycanthropes, it has been enhanced through the reincarnation of her brother’s soul, bolstering its magical properties and creating a potent weapon against those who prey on the innocent.  This weapon provides a symbolic link to her lost brother and strengthens her resolve in her quest for justice. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Hene's sharp wit and sarcastic banter are often directed at Bungo Dudo, a halfling scholar, whose lengthy explanations she finds both irritating and fascinating. Despite their initial clashes, Hene eventually recognizes the value of Bungo's knowledge and his contributions to the group's success, especially in deciphering ancient texts and interpreting arcane mysteries. She maintains her humor, often with sarcastic remarks, even in the toughest of situations, balancing her stoicism with moments of levity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph normal\">\n  <p>Despite her tough exterior and unwavering pursuit of justice, Hene is deeply affected by the loss of her brother, an event that continues to shape her journey. At the end of the campaign, Hene remains committed to her faith and her oath to Tyr, continuing her fight for justice and the protection of the innocent, even as she finds a path to personal peace and fulfillment beyond simple revenge. This allows her to continue fighting for those who are vulnerable, and continue to carry the torch of justice in a world forever altered by the Great Descent.</p>\n</div>",
