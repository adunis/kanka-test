    "entry": "<div>\n  <h2>Azara's Fall: From Githzerai Monk to Traitor</h2>\n  <p>Azara, a once-promising Githzerai monk and magus, was renowned for her unwavering commitment to mental discipline and the pursuit of balance.  Her dedication to the Githzerai way of life was absolute, making her a valued member of her community. However, during a profound meditative state, she received a telepathic communication from Xul'koroth, the Aboleth Patron. This communication consisted of visions, skillfully crafted to exploit Azara's insecurities and her fervent desire for the prosperity of her people.</p>\n  <p>Xul'koroth presented Azara with visions of a unified universe governed by a single, unyielding order—a realm free from the perpetual chaos plaguing both the Githzerai and their Githyanki counterparts.  This utopian vision resonated deeply with Azara, appealing to her longing for peace and stability for her people.  Exploiting her deepest desires and fears, Xul'koroth offered her the power to realize this dream, convincing her that only through his guidance could she bring about lasting peace.  Azara, believing in the righteousness of her cause and swayed by the Aboleth's insidious manipulations, ultimately betrayed her people, stealing powerful secrets and artifacts to aid Xul'koroth’s overarching schemes for godhood and multiversal dominion.</p>\n\n  <h2>Azara: A Githzerai Fugitive</h2>\n  <p>Azara's pivotal role in the events surrounding the Netherese Globes and Xul'koroth's plans for divine ascension is undeniable. Information strongly suggests that Azara, a powerful Githzerai magus, is deeply involved in these schemes. Her expertise in planar travel, particularly her ability to cast the <i>Planeshift</i> spell, was crucial to Xul'koroth's operation. This expertise allowed her to travel to and from various planes, facilitating the Aboleth's manipulations and access to potent artifacts.</p>\n  <p>Furthermore, Azara's actions directly caused widespread chaos and destruction.  She used a Netherese artifact in her possession to summon demons, unleashing a terrifying assault upon Airspur, the capital of Akanul, weakening its defenses and paving the way for the theft of the Urn of Geb, a Netherese Globe connected to Geb, the Mulhorandi god of earth. This act of aggression confirms her active collaboration with the Aboleth and demonstrates the catastrophic scale of her betrayal.</p>\n\n  <h3>Key Details About Azara:</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Azara is a fugitive Githzerai:</strong> She is actively fleeing her own people, likely due to the serious transgressions and conflicting ideologies stemming from her betrayal. B.B. specifically sought her out because of her ability to cast <i>Planeshift</i>, essential for reaching the plane of Limbo, suggesting a desperate flight from justice and a possible connection to the Netherese artifacts plundered in Airspur.</li>\n    <li><strong>Azara is a powerful magus:</strong> Her expertise in casting <i>Planeshift</i>, a high-level spell requiring significant magical skill and knowledge of planar travel, showcases her considerable magical prowess and deep understanding of extraplanar phenomena.</li>\n    <li><strong>Azara is connected to the Patron's plans:</strong> She has been instrumental in the events orchestrated by Xul'koroth, playing a critical role in his ambition to achieve godhood through manipulation and the acquisition of Netherese Globes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Azara used a Netherese artifact to attack Airspur:</strong> Her summoning of demons during the attack on Airspur not only demonstrates her access to powerful Netherese artifacts but also reveals the depth of her commitment to Xul'koroth's plans, highlighting her willingness to cause widespread destruction in pursuit of the Aboleth's ultimate goals.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>",
