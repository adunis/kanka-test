    "entry": "<div>\n  <h2 class=\"paragraph heading2\">Godfrey: The Murdered Doctor of Halendos, a Village Scarred by the Great Descent</h2>\n  <p class=\"paragraph normal\">Godfrey, a respected doctor in the remote village of Halendos, was found dead under suspicious circumstances after the cataclysmic Great Descent. Initially ruled a suicide, his demise masked a darker truth, a consequence of the world-altering divine war.</p>\n  <p class=\"paragraph normal\"> Halendos, like many settlements clinging to existence after the Old Gods' war, now suffers under a new kind of fear: not of divine wrath, but of what twisted echoes of that power remain. The following details unveil the secrets surrounding Godfrey’s death and a new understanding of Halendos in this post-apocalyptic setting.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li class=\"bullet normal\">\n      <p class=\"paragraph normal\">\n        <span class=\"bold\">The Mystery Surrounding Godfrey's Death:</span> The initial investigation focused on suicide, given a scalpel clutched in Godfrey's hand and a wound on his trachea. The young cleric Tilmanna, hardened by the Great Descent and trained to identify unnatural influences, conducted a thorough autopsy. Her grim findings revealed Silver Fang serpent venom, a toxin prized by assassins from Chessentia and known to thrive in areas touched by abyssal energies. This discovery confirmed the murder and suggested ties beyond the village's immediate concerns. The poison was untraceable, an indication that the culprit had either alchemical knowledge from before the Great Descent or access to the twisted mutations that thrived in the Abyssal rifts.\n      </p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"bullet normal\">\n      <p class=\"paragraph normal\">\n        <span class=\"bold\">Suspects and Motives in a World Changed:</span> The investigation quickly zeroed in on Apela, Godfrey's secret lover, a courtesan known for extracting secrets like venom, and Vitali, his enigmatic assistant, a master of poisons with a hidden affection for the deceased. Apela, questioned under oath, claimed abduction, transported to a vampire's mausoleum outside of the village before the death, though her memory was clouded. Vitali claimed he had been attempting to study the effects of Silver Fang venom as a potential cure to maladies caused by divine influence. Adding to the intrigue, Apela, who maintained a collection of Chessentian poisons, reported the theft of Silver Fang venom before Godfrey's death. Suspicion arose that an outside power could be responsible, possibly influenced by one of the Netherese Globi, given the rarity of the poison and the intricate plot.\n      </p>\n    </li>\n    <li class=\"bullet normal\">\n      <p class=\"paragraph normal\">\n        <span class=\"bold\">Godfrey's Theory about Halendos: A Village Sacrificing to a Cosmic Being?</span> Godfrey’s notes detailed a disturbing pattern: young villagers vanished during the annual Spring Festival after being sent into the forest at night in an intoxicated state, a possible sacrifice to an entity that arrived on Faerun during the Great Descent. The villagers seemed oblivious to these disappearances, noticing months later, suspecting a malevolent entity or remnants of Old Gods. Godfrey suspected sacrifices to malevolent deities who manipulate the villagers, possibly Xul'koroth from the Reame Remoto. He also noted their deep seated belief that Halendos was spared the worst of the Great Descent for reasons known only to the village elders.\n      </p>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p class=\"paragraph normal\">Godfrey's untimely death cut short his investigation, yet his suspicions and observations provided valuable leads for those seeking to uncover the sinister undercurrents plaguing Halendos. After the events in the village and his involvement with the investigation, Tilmanna gained the reputation as the young cleric from Halendos who solved a dark mystery. This new found fame has thrust her into the middle of a choice: remain in the isolated village of Halendos or embark on a journey to spread the light of her god and to help the many people that suffered from the events of the Great Descent.</p>\n</div>",
