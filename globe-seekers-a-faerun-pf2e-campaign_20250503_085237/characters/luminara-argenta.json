{"id":1767852,"name":"Luminara Argenta","campaign_id":273567,"entry":"<div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The High Priestess of Selune, <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Luminara Argenta<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, is a figure shrouded in mystery and reverence.  She is a woman of unparalleled grace and wisdom, her silver hair cascading down her back like a waterfall of moonlight, her eyes shimmering with the reflected light of a thousand stars. Luminara is not merely a chosen leader; she is believed to be a direct descendant of Selune's first mortal champion, inheriting a sacred bloodline that grants her a profound connection to the goddess. This connection allows Luminara to receive visions from Selune, guiding her in protecting the faithful and safeguarding the secrets of the church, including the location of the Heavenly Staircase.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Temple of Selune in Suzail<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> is a testament to the goddess's grace and power. Located on the highest point within the city's walls, the temple's white marble structure seems to glow with an ethereal light, its towers reaching towards the heavens like supplicating hands. The temple's design incorporates elements of both elven and human architecture, reflecting Selune's role as a unifier and a protector of all races. The entrance is flanked by two colossal statues of unicorns, their silver horns gleaming under the moonlight, symbolizing purity and divine guidance. Inside, the temple is a labyrinth of interconnected chambers and corridors, each adorned with intricate mosaics depicting scenes from Selune's mythology. The air is thick with the scent of incense and the soft glow of countless candles, creating an atmosphere of serene contemplation.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">At the heart of the temple lies the Sanctum of the Moon, a circular chamber bathed in an ethereal silver light emanating from a large crystal orb suspended from the ceiling.<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> This orb, known as the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Tear of Selune<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, is believed to be a fragment of Selune's own divine essence, capable of amplifying the High Priestess's connection to the goddess and revealing glimpses of the Heavenly Staircase's location. This location is not a fixed place; it shifts and moves across the planes, appearing only when the celestial alignment is right and a soul worthy of ascension is present.  Luminara, through her bloodline and communion with Selune, receives visions of the Staircase's location, but these visions are often cryptic and fleeting, appearing as fragmented landscapes and shimmering pathways that exist beyond the veil of reality. The Aboleth Patron, with his vast knowledge of ancient lore and his desire to ascend to godhood, poses a significant threat to the temple. His agents may seek to infiltrate the temple, searching for clues to the Staircase's location or attempting to disrupt Luminara's connection to Selune.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Here are some additional details that might be helpful for your next session:<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Luminara Silverstream's Personality:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> She is a kind and compassionate woman, deeply devoted to Selune and the protection of the innocent.
