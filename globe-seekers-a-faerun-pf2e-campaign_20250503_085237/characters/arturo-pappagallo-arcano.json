But the Great Descent brought unforeseen chaos. Now, more than just a feathered friend, Arturo became a symbol of resilience in a shattered world.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Details</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><strong>Subject:</strong> Arturo, Diego's parrot.</li>\n        <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Diego Gonzalo Jimenez, a Ranger by trade and fortune.</li>\n        <li><strong>Fate After the Great Descent:</strong> Diego and Arturo are known to travel the Sea of Fallen Stars, helping protect coastal settlements from the Kraken King's forces and other sea-based threats. Arturo often acts as a scout, his keen eyesight and ability to mimic sounds making him an invaluable asset.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Background and Lore</h2>\n      <p>Before the Great Descent, Arturo was simply Diego's intelligent and chatty parrot. However, after the cataclysmic divine war and the sundering of planes, the world changed. Arturo developed some magical properties due to the residual energies of the conflict that still permeates the land and sea. He could once revive himself for a brief moment if killed thanks to Diego’s magical tears – a feat no longer possible since the gods departed, taking their divine magic with them, even as that magic permeates the land. </p>\n      <p>Today, Arturo is recognized along the coasts of the Sea of Fallen Stars and elsewhere as a warning signal for danger. Those who know the pair respect the macaw as much as its ranger master. Smugglers, slavers, and pirates, above all, recognize the pair as a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Post-Descent Implications and Hooks</h2>\n      <p>After the Great Descent, Arturo's presence offers several plot hooks for your Pathfinder 2e campaign:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Spying &amp; Scouting Missions:</strong> Diego, contracted by a village elder, could ask the party to provide safety as Diego and Arturo scout a location known for coastal raids. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Lost at Sea:</strong> Diego's ship, the <i>Rapace delle Tempeste</i>, could be lost in a storm, leaving Arturo as the sole survivor, leading the party to find Diego who is left at the mercy of the coasts that have been claimed by the sahuagin.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n         <strong>Rumors of a Lost Treasure:</strong> A tale about an ancient temple dedicated to Umberlee, now claimed by the Kraken Society, promises great rewards but is surrounded by dangerous creatures. Arturo, with his ability to scout, becomes an invaluable asset to the party.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <strong>Artifact Recovery:</strong> Diego and Arturo possess knowledge of a long-lost Netherese artifact hidden somewhere along the Sword Coast. A mysterious benefactor asks the party to help Diego, leading them on a journey that tests their loyalties and moral boundaries.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n\n    <section>\n      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Arturo can mimic various sounds, including voices, giving him an edge when gathering information.</li>\n        <li>Arturo's vibrant plumage makes him easily recognizable, which can be both an advantage and a liability.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </section>\n  </article>\n</main>",
