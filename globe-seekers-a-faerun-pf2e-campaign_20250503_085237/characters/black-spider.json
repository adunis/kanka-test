    "entry": "<div>\n  <h2>The Black Spider: A Renegade Drow Wizard</h2>\n  <p>\n    The Black Spider, formerly known as Velg'larn, is a\n    <b>renegade Drow wizard</b>, originally from aiding the School of\n    Necromancy in [location:6880456]. Velg'larn fled the Underdark long\n    before the Great Descent, seeking forbidden knowledge. The Great Descent,\n    however, amplified the dangers of his past as he now collaborates with the\n    Withered Thumb druids, a faction experimenting with dark magic. Their\n    operations are centered around Cragmaw Castle, once a thriving fortress now\n    a haunted ruin, twisting goblinoids using spores.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To travel, The Black Spider needs to use a teleportation circle hidden in a\n    butcher's shop in Sshamath, a serious violation of Sshamath law and could\n    lead to exile, though the departure of the gods and the collapse of the\n    celestial stair has diminished the importance of such rules. Getting\n    captured by Menzoberranzan's priestesses is a fate worse than death for\n    Drow wizards like the Black Spider, and he seeks to avoid this at all\n    costs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    After the Great Descent, The Black Spider has embraced a new purpose: To\n    <b>find or recreate the Lunar Scourge</b>, an artefact designed to be lethal\n    against werewolves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Black Spider believes that the [item:6880457] holds the power to end\n    his lycanthropy curse. He also seeks to offer it to Ms Xenia Koroth, a\n    powerful Aboleth that promises to restore his original self. His\n    experiments have attracted the attention of unsavory factions in Faer√ªn and\n    beyond, and he now finds himself trapped in a web of intrigue that reaches\n    far beyond the wilds of the Sword Coast.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The Black Spider captured [character:6751877] Rockseeker, believing that\n    his knowledge holds the key to recovering an ancient map leading to the\n    Scale Celeste and intended to sell him into slavery, guarded by stone\n    giants, mind flayers, and duergar.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To this end, the Black Spider is collaborating with the Withered Thumb\n    druids, a faction experimenting with dark magic in Cragmaw Castle,\n    including using spores to control goblinoids. This collaboration extends\n    beyond mere convenience, as the Black Spider seeks to weaponize the druids'\n    spore creations to create a vast army of mind-controlled goblinoids.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    During their investigation, the Black Spider was encountered at the Ruins of\n    Cragmaw Keep, during his attempt to weaponize Agatha the Banshee, Eco of an\n    Era Perduta, who had taken refuge, in that era, in a forest now haunted by\n    the specter of a banshee with prophetic visions and whispers of a lost era.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    During the climatic battle with The Black Spider, Hene, under the guidance\n    of Tyr and in the name of righteousness, did not hold back in wielding the\n    power of the Scourge and smote the The Black Spider to death, freeing\n    Agatha from his wicked control.\n  </p>\n  This alliance has led to Rockseeker being forced into labor under Duergar\n  masters, while the mind flayers experimented with him in the hopes of\n  mastering an ancient and forgotten astral map that would guide them to the\n  Scale Celeste.\n</div>",
