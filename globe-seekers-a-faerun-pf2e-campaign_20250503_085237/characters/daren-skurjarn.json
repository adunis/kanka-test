Despite the passage of years, echoes of his actions resonate throughout the land.</span></div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">●</div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Daren is Er Tozzo's brother:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> This familial connection is what fuels Er Tozzo's burning desire to confront him.

His motivations are still debated among the Khaldar people. Some believe he was swayed by promises of power, while others whisper of coercion or a secret pact with the Patron.</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"></span></div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"></span><span class=\"ng-inserted\">.</span></div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">●</div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Involvement in Damara's War Preparations:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Khaldarin's forges now churn out weapons and armour for Damara under Daren's supervision, contributing to the region's instability. Whispers suggest Daren might even be experimenting with binding Abyssal energies into the metalwork, creating weapons of horrific power for Damara. His continued control over Khaldarin's forges makes him a strategic asset for Damara, and by extension, for The Patron.</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"></span></div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"></span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.</span></div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">●</div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Motivations Remain Unknown:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n The reason for Daren's betrayal, and his cooperation with Xul'koroth, \nremains a key question that Er Tozzo hopes to have answered during their\n confrontation. Some whisper that the Daemon offered him visions of a \nworld free from the influence of the often-uncaring or outright hostile \ngods, a world where mortals like the Khaldar could shape their own \ndestiny - a lie carefully crafted to appeal to a deep-seated \ndiscontent. Regardless, his brother seeks to undo what Daren started.</span></div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Er Tozzo's Ultimate Goal:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Er Tozzo seeks to liberate Khaldarin and confront his traitorous brother, bringing about justice - or perhaps, in the grim reality of the post-Descent world, vengeance. Daren's actions are a constant reminder of the broken bonds and the corrupting influence of power.</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"></span></div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-inserted\"></span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.

Some texts suggest that he made a pilgrimage at the Shrine to the Wounded to receive additional knowledge.</span></div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">●</div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Nature of His Collaboration:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> It is speculated that Daren, seeking to further his own power, sought out a powerful contract to receive a special weapon at the Shrine of the Wounded near Impiltur and that perhaps Azara (la Githzerai), at some point, knew of this plan. This information needs confirmation.</span></div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">●</div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Potential for Redemption:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">\n In the grim reality of the post-Descent world, the hope for redemption \nis a flickering candle in the wind. Daren's potential path forward could\n be as a tragic antagonist, his soul so twisted that reconciliation with\n Er Tozzo is impossible and only a violent clash between the two can \nresolve the ancient dispute. This is all pure invention, \nhowever.</span></div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Daren's Significance:</span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Daren Fireforge's actions have set in motion a chain of events that could determine the fate of Khaldarin and potentially, the entire region. Unraveling his secrets and confronting him is not just a personal quest for Er Tozzo; it is a crucial step in understanding and opposing the larger threat posed by Xul'koroth and his allies. His choice will have lasting repercussions, making him a key figure in the unfolding narrative.</span></div><p><br><br></p>",
