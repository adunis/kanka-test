Some believe he sought refuge in the corrupted ruins of Old Owl Well.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <b>A Lost Spellbook:</b>\n      <span>Driven by a thirst for lost knowledge, Vaeril sought to claim an ancient spellbook rumored to rest within Old Owl Well, delving into the ruins in a desperate attempt to augment his own powers to become something much greater than a mere Redbrand. But his ambition was foiled.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <b>The Shadow of the Spider:</b>\n      <span>Pursued relentlessly by Azara, a Githzerai fleeing cosmic forces and seeking lost Netherese artifacts. After the encounter with the party, Vaeril sought refuge with the Black Spider, a renegade drow wizard, at Cragmaw Castle, however in the battle that followed the black spider was killed, leaving Vaeril without allies.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <b>Whispers of the Deep:</b>\n      <span>Now alone, Vaeril is rumored to be experimenting with energies gleaned from the Far Realm, an ambition that has attracted the attention of unsavory factions, such as the Cult of the Dragon, seeking to resurrect long-dead dracoliches, or the Aboleth Patron. The Aboleth seeks to subvert all planes to its will. His fate is a chilling reminder of the price of ambition in a world forever changed by the Great Descent.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n  <b>PLOT HOOKS:</b>\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <span>Vaeril, seeking to recover the \"Rod Metallica\" needed to complete the planshifting ritual, tasks the adventurers to steal it from the wizard Vaeril under the orders of Azara.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <span>The players are contacted by a Knight of the Order of the Emerald Eye from Neverwinter, who tasked them with hunting down Glasstaff, but he reveals that is really a vampire and Vaeril's ally.</span>\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ul>",
