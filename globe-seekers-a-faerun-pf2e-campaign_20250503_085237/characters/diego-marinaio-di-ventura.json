Costretto a lavorare fin da giovane nella compagnia di costruzione navale di suo padre, Diego sognava di solcare i mari, ma era intrappolato a terra, osservando con invidia coloro che partivano per l'ignoto.<br>Il suo unico conforto era il legame con suo sorella minore, Miguela, con cui condivideva il desiderio di avventura. Tuttavia, la loro nemesi, un crudele cugino di nome Rafael, lavorava instancabilmente per ostacolare i loro sogni e guadagnare favori presso il padre.<br>Determinato a sfuggire a questa vita, Diego mise da parte dei soldi e si unì a una compagnia esplorativa diretta a nord. Durante una spedizione in antiche rovine, Diego subì gravi ferite, guadagnandosi cicatrici permanenti, mentre molti dei suoi compagni persero la vita. Nonostante le avversità, riuscì a recuperare un baule contenente un misterioso fischietto fatto di ossa.<br>Quando Diego soffiò nel fischietto, apparve un pappagallo che da quel momento divenne il suo fedele compagno, e decise di chiamarlo Arturo. Le rovine si rivelarono essere un antico tempio dedicato a una divinità dimenticata, custode di segreti e artefatti magici. Il fischietto, in particolare, era un potente strumento creato dagli aventi ( https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aearee) , un'antica razza di uccelli umanoidi, in grado di evocare e controllare creature alate.<br>Al ritorno dalla spedizione, Diego decise di arruolarsi come mozzo su una nave per inseguire il suo sogno di navigare. Per un decennio, passò da una nave all'altra, affinando le sue abilità come marinaio e ranger, addestrando bestie esotiche incontrate durante i suoi viaggi.<br>Tuttavia, il suo passato lo raggiunse quando scoprì che Raphael, ora un potente agente dei vampiri che governano Amn, aveva ordito un complotto per rovinare la compagnia navale di suo padre e costringere Miguela a sposarsi con lui.  Tuttavia, prima che Diego potesse agire, Rafael partì, portando con se’ Miguela, per una missione segreta verso il Mare delle Stelle Cadute (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sea_of_Fallen_Stars) per conto della nazione di Amn. Diego vide questa come un'opportunità per vendicarsi di Rafael mentre era lontano dalla protezione di Amn. Decise di dirigersi verso il Mare delle Stelle Cadute, sperando di incrociare il cammino di Raphael e regolare i conti una volta per tutte.<br><br></span><img src=\"https://d3a4xjr8r2ldhu.cloudfront.net/campaigns/273567/9d6c99a8-3223-4b15-bc86-2d0ea41aacd8.png\" data-gallery-id=\"9d6c99a8-3223-4b15-bc86-2d0ea41aacd8\" alt=\"9d6c99a8-3223-4b15-bc86-2d0ea41aacd8.png\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><br><br><br></span></div>",
