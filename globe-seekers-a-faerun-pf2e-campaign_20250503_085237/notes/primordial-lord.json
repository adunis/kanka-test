Unlike gods who draw power from belief and worship, the Primordial Lords exist as eternal forces of nature, inseparable from the fabric of reality they personify. They are not conscious in the mortal sense; their thoughts are vast, alien, and tied to the cycles of the cosmos. To interact with the worlds beyond their planes, they rely on their Djinn emissaries, mighty elemental beings imbued with a fraction of their power. The Lords' motives are tied to maintaining the equilibrium of existence, a task that pits them against the encroachment of gods and the disruptions of mortal civilizations.<\/p><p>In appearance, each Primordial Lord is an awe-inspiring, ever-shifting form that defies mortal comprehension: a hurricane that whispers truths, a mountain that breathes, or a flame that sings creation\u2019s song.
