These ancestors of giants spoke <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Jotun<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, a language not of words but of resonant concepts.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Echoes of Creation:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Jotun is less about conveying specific information and more about aligning one's will with the forces of creation. It is a language of deep, guttural sounds that vibrate through the very earth, resonating with the essence of stone and metal.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">A Language of Shaping:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">  Imagine the Stone Shapers using Jotun to command the flow of molten metal, to raise mountains with a whispered phrase, or to imbue their colossal creations with a purpose that transcended mortal understanding.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Dwarven Inheritance:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The dwarves, having learned from the giants, adapted Runic into their own tongue. While dwarven languages retained some of the primal resonance of Jotun, they evolved to become more precise, more structured, better suited to the dwarves' focus on craftsmanship and detail.  Traces of Jotun can still be seen in dwarven runes, symbols that hold power and meaning that echoes the giants' ancient might.<\/span><\/div><p><\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-18T00:08:30.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T00:08:30.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":null,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
