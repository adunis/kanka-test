Unlike other divine or celestial beings, demons are driven by an insatiable hunger for the raw energies at the heart of creation, and they exist solely to consume and spread their influence across the multiverse. When the Abyss discovered the Primordial Plane, it began an unending invasion, sending forth waves of demons to breach the protective barriers of the Prime Planes and claim the powerful essence that sustains the cosmos. Demons are inherently chaotic, their forms and minds twisted by the Abyss, and they wield powers that corrupt and distort reality itself. This destructive ambition has made them the eternal adversaries of the gods and their celestial armies, who constantly strive to contain the Abyss's influence. Though the gods have allied to fight the demonic forces, their war with the Abyss has become a ceaseless, devastating struggle that spans the planes, with demons seeking every opportunity to sow discord, destroy, and corrupt the souls that are meant to fuel the divine realms.<\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-14T10:15:24.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T10:18:28.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":"9d7c7a24-00c2-4f85-b039-ef269892ad52","header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null},"pivotLocations":[]}
