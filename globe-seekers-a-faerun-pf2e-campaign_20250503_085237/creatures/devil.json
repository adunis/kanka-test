Each of these deities has crafted a realm reflecting their own nature\u2014authority, tyranny, murder, and greed\u2014and populated it with devils who embody these aspects through strict hierarchy and ruthless enforcement. In Asmodeus's <strong>Hell of Authority<\/strong>, devils like Pit Fiends and Erinyes uphold volcanic fortresses bound by burning chains, enforcing contracts and dominion. Bane's <strong>Hell of Tyranny<\/strong> is ruled by Ice Devils and Enforcers who preside over desert citadels beneath blood-red skies, embodying oppression and control. In Bhaal's <strong>Hell of Murder<\/strong>, Assassin Devils and Shadow Devils roam endless hunting grounds soaked in blood, perpetuating cycles of violence and betrayal. Tiamat's <strong>Hell of Greed<\/strong> is filled with Abishai and Hoard Keepers guarding caverns of treasure and flame, representing avarice and ambition.<\/p><p>Unlike the chaotic demons of the Abyss, devils adhere to a strict hierarchy and meticulous order. They serve their deities by tempting mortals, enforcing infernal laws, and corrupting souls through binding contracts. These agreements often promise power, wealth, or knowledge but ultimately claim the souls of those who enter them. This transactional approach is central to their strategy, as they aim to expand their legions and amplify their deities' influence. Through calculated manipulation and unwavering obedience, devils act as both emissaries and enforcers for Asmodeus, Bane, Bhaal, and Tiamat, perpetuating an unending cycle of temptation, domination, and soul harvesting across the multiverse.<\/p><p><\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-10T08:01:59.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-14T10:19:42.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null},"pivotLocations":[]}
