Unlike zombies, which retain decaying flesh and a semblance of their former selves, skeletons are stripped down to their bony essence, animated by precise enchantments that tap directly into arcane energies, leaving them eerily silent and disturbingly agile. Vecna's disciples believe that skeletons represent a \"purer\" form of undeath, unmarred by the burdens of rot and decay, perfect vessels for arcane control and a twisted reflection of the Old Gods' reign.</p>\n      <p>Before the Great Descent, the art of raising skeletons was a closely guarded secret, a gift Vecna reserved for his most devout followers—clerics and necromancers who devoted themselves to unlocking and preserving ancient mysteries.  After the Great Descent, however, with the weakening of the divine and the fracturing of the Weave, this knowledge spread, whispered among ambitious sorcerers and necromancers who sought to exploit its potential in the new, unstable world. The Black Spider, for example, sought to exploit this power to create an army of mind-controlled goblinoids.</p>\n      <p>While zombies require brute necromantic force to shamble, skeletons are bound by a unique enchantment Vecna devised. This allows them a disturbing agility and the capacity to understand basic commands. Some scholars speculate that the bones themselves resonate with faint echoes of the deceased's memories, as skeletons have been observed wielding weapons and executing rudimentary battlefield tactics. After the Great Descent, many skeletons exhibit increased instability, some even exhibiting traces of aberrant energies from the Abyss or the Far Realm, reflecting the fractured state of the multiverse.</p>\n      <p> Though they are inherently soulless, there are persistent rumors that Vecna occasionally instills fragments of forbidden knowledge within their empty skulls, imbuing them with a dark semblance of purpose and further twisting them into instruments of his silent agenda: ultimate dominion over life and death. Recent discoveries show that some skeletons exhibit an odd resistance to holy energy.</p>\n      <p><strong>Plot Hooks:</strong> Investigating the source of increased skeletal instability. Uncovering the true extent of Vecna's influence on the skeletons. Discovering a method to control or disrupt the enchantment binding the skeletons, potentially allowing them to be used against Vecna's forces.</p>\n    </section>\n  </article>\n</main>",
