Unlike the elves of the Material Plane, the Eladrin possessed a deep connection to the plane's raw magic, their very emotions and thoughts shaping the landscape around them.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Imagine a time when mountains rose and fell with the tides of joy and sorrow, forests bloomed with the whispers of love, and rivers flowed with the currents of dreams.  This was the Feywild under the Eladrin: a realm of untamed beauty and chaotic wonder.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Eladrin established a civilisation that thrived on this symbiotic relationship with the plane. Their cities were living works of art, woven from the fabric of the Feywild itself, changing and adapting with the flow of magic. They lived in harmony with the Fey creatures that sprung from their collective imagination, forming complex societies where art, music, and magic intertwined.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Seeds of Discord and the Sundering<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">However, this harmonious existence was not to last. As the Eladrin civilization grew, so too did their individual desires and ambitions. The raw magic of the Feywild, once a source of unity, began to fuel their individual passions, leading to discord and conflict.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Some Eladrin sought to control the Feywild's magic for their own gain, manipulating the landscape to suit their desires. Others retreated from the increasingly chaotic world, seeking refuge in remote corners of the plane. This division fractured the Eladrin civilization, weakening their connection to the Feywild and diminishing their ability to shape its reality.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">This period of conflict culminated in a cataclysmic event known as the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Sundering<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  The sources do not mention this event, so it is purely imaginative and based on general concepts found in fantasy literature about the Feywild and the origins of elves. It was a time of great upheaval, where the raw magic of the Feywild erupted in a storm of chaotic energy.  The landscape warped and twisted, entire regions were reshaped, and the boundaries between the Feywild and other planes weakened, creating portals to realms unknown.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Exodus and the Rise of the Fey<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">In the aftermath of the Sundering, many Eladrin chose to leave the Feywild, seeking a more stable existence.  They crossed the weakened planar boundaries, migrating to the Material Plane and other realms.  These Eladrin became the ancestors of the elves, their connection to the Feywild diluted but not entirely severed.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Feywild, left to its own devices, began to evolve in the absence of the Eladrin. The Fey creatures, once reflections of the Eladrin's imagination, gained independence, becoming the dominant force in this new, untamed world.  The once-ordered cities of the Eladrin fell into ruin, overgrown with vibrant, chaotic vegetation.  Their magic lingered, however, imbuing the landscape with an aura of enchantment and wonder.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Feywild Today: A Realm of Contrasts<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Feywild of today is a realm of contrasts, where beauty and danger coexist in a delicate balance. It's a place where reality is fluid, shaped by emotions and beliefs.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Geography of Enchantment:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Imagine forests where trees whisper secrets, rivers that flow uphill, and mountains that shift and change with the passing of seasons. The Feywild's landscape is a tapestry of vibrant colours, strange flora, and unpredictable terrain.  Here, gravity might be a suggestion rather than a law, and time flows differently, sometimes speeding up, sometimes slowing down, and occasionally even flowing in reverse.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Fey Courts:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The Fey creatures, no longer mere reflections of the Eladrin, have developed their own complex societies. The most prominent are the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Fey Courts<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, ruled by powerful archfey who embody different aspects of the Feywild's nature. The Seelie Court, associated with beauty, light, and revelry, and the Unseelie Court, representing darkness, wildness, and trickery, are constantly vying for power, their conflicts shaping the fate of the Feywild.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Legacy of the Eladrin:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The remnants of the Eladrin civilisation can still be found scattered throughout the Feywild.  Ruined cities overgrown with enchanted vegetation, ancient artifacts imbued with potent magic, and lingering enchantments that warp reality itself are a testament to their once-dominant presence.  These remnants are often sought by adventurers and scholars seeking knowledge of the Feywild's past or hoping to harness the Eladrin's lost magic.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">A Realm of Perpetual Twilight:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The Feywild exists in a state of perpetual twilight or dawn,<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> with the sun and moon seemingly frozen in the sky.  This ethereal light bathes the landscape in a soft, otherworldly glow, creating an atmosphere of mystery and enchantment.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Ecology of Wonder:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The Feywild's ecosystem is a reflection of its magical nature.  Plants grow with astonishing speed, flowers bloom in impossible colours, and animals possess strange and wondrous abilities.  The creatures of the Feywild are often imbued with magic, ranging from playful sprites and mischievous pixies to terrifying hags and powerful unicorns.<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Enduring Echoes of the Past<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The departure of the Eladrin did not erase their legacy.  Their influence can still be felt in the Feywild, shaping its reality in subtle and profound ways.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Lingering Enchantments:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The Eladrin's mastery of magic infused the Feywild with a lasting enchantment.  These enchantments can manifest in various ways, from warping the flow of time to imbuing objects with sentience.  They are often unpredictable and dangerous, reflecting the chaotic nature of the Feywild's magic.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Cultural Legacies:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Some Fey creatures have adopted aspects of Eladrin culture, preserving their art, music, and traditions.  These echoes of the past can be seen in the intricate designs of Fey architecture, the haunting melodies of Fey music, and the elaborate rituals practiced by some Fey Courts.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Remnants of Power:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> The Eladrin left behind powerful artifacts and magical sites scattered throughout the Feywild.  These remnants are often guarded by powerful Fey creatures or concealed by potent enchantments.  They are sought by those who seek to harness the Eladrin's lost power or unlock the secrets of their civilisation.<\/span><\/div>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-17T23:07:07.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T10:43:26.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
