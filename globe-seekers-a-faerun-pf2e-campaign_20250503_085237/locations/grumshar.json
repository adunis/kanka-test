These beings were not the savage brutes often depicted in tales of the Material Plane. The Ironforged were masters of metal and stone, their civilisation a testament to their strength and resilience.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Iron Age of Grumshar<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Ironforged arose from the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">War Titans<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, beings of immense size and power who embodied the raw energy of conflict<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  These titans shaped the harsh landscapes of Grumshar, their battles carving mountains and forging valleys. From the sweat and sparks of these titanic clashes, the Ironforged emerged, inheriting their ancestors' strength and a deep connection to the plane's elemental forces.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Unlike the orcs of other worlds, the Ironforged possessed an innate understanding of metalwork. They mined the rich veins of iron and other metals that ran through Grumshar's mountains, forging weapons, armor, and tools of extraordinary quality. Their cities were fortresses of iron and stone, built to withstand the constant tremors and elemental storms that ravaged the plane.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Ironforged society was structured around a strict hierarchy based on strength and martial prowess. Warlords led their clans in constant battles for territory and resources, their clashes echoing the titanic conflicts of their ancestors. Yet, amidst this perpetual conflict, there existed a code of honour and respect among the Ironforged. They valued courage, loyalty, and mastery of combat, seeing these qualities as essential for survival in Grumshar's unforgiving environment.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Cataclysm and the Shattering<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Ironforged dominance, however, was not destined to last.  Their mastery of metal and their reverence for the War Titans inadvertently led to their downfall. Deep within Grumshar's core, they discovered a heart of solidified shadow, a remnant of a fallen War Titan consumed by the plane's death energy.  The Ironforged, believing this heart to be a source of immense power, attempted to forge it into a weapon of unparalleled might.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Their actions, however, had unforeseen consequences. The heart, corrupted by death energy, reacted violently to the Ironforged's attempts to manipulate it. This triggered a cataclysmic event known as the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Shattering<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  This event is not mentioned in the sources and is a purely imaginative interpretation of possible events that led to the decline of the Ironforged.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The heart shattered into countless fragments, each carrying a shard of the fallen titan's corrupted power.  These fragments spread across Grumshar, twisting the land and corrupting the Ironforged's own metalwork. Their once-proud cities crumbled, their weapons turned brittle, and their armor became heavy and cumbersome.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Worse still, the shattered heart's energy poisoned the minds of many Ironforged, driving them to madness and savagery.  The once-ordered society descended into chaos, clans turning on each other in a brutal struggle for survival.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Exodus and the Rise of New Powers<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">In the face of this cataclysm, many Ironforged chose to flee Grumshar, seeking refuge on other planes.  They crossed planar boundaries, their corrupted forms gradually transforming over generations into the orcs known throughout the multiverse.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Grumshar they left behind was a shadow of its former self. The shattered heart's influence lingered, twisting the landscape and imbuing the plane with a pervasive aura of death and decay. The remaining Ironforged, their minds poisoned by the corrupted energy, devolved into savage tribes, their once-advanced knowledge lost to the ravages of time.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">In the absence of the Ironforged, new powers arose in Grumshar.  Creatures adapted to the plane's harsh conditions, evolving unique abilities to survive amidst the death-infused environment.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Bone Giants:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">  These towering behemoths, formed from the skeletal remains of fallen creatures, embody the plane's death energy. They roam the desolate plains, their bones clattering like thunder, their touch draining the life from anything they grasp.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Shadowforged:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> A twisted reflection of their Ironforged ancestors, these beings are creatures of shadow and metal, their forms constantly shifting and reforming. They dwell in the ruins of Ironforged cities, their minds warped by the shattered heart's lingering energy.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Gloomlings:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Small, goblin-like creatures that thrive in the darkness, they are scavengers and opportunists, preying on the weak and stealing whatever they can find. They possess an uncanny ability to navigate Grumshar's treacherous landscapes, their eyes piercing the gloom with unnatural clarity.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">A Realm Shaped by Conflict<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Grumshar today is a realm of desolate beauty, shaped by the enduring echoes of its past.  The remnants of the Ironforged civilisation can still be found, their ruined cities standing as testament to their former glory.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Iron Citadels:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> Crumbling fortresses of iron and stone, these once-impregnable strongholds now lie in ruins, haunted by the spirits of fallen Ironforged. Their walls bear the scars of ancient battles and the corrosive touch of the shattered heart's energy.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Forges of Sorrow:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">  These ancient workshops, once used to craft weapons of extraordinary quality, now lie dormant, their furnaces cold and their anvils silent.  The shattered heart's energy has warped the metal within these forges, rendering them unusable.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Echoes of War:<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">  The constant battles of the Ironforged have left a lasting imprint on Grumshar. The ground trembles with the echoes of their footsteps, the air crackles with the remnants of their magic, and the wind carries the whispers of their war cries.  These echoes can drive travellers to madness or inspire them to feats of great strength and courage.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Cycle of Conflict<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Grumshar's history is a cycle of conflict, from the titanic clashes of the War Titans to the brutal wars of the Ironforged and the ongoing struggles of the creatures that now inhabit the plane. The remnants of the Ironforged civilization serve as a constant reminder of the power and the perils of unchecked ambition.<\/span><\/div>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-17T23:07:08.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T10:45:03.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
