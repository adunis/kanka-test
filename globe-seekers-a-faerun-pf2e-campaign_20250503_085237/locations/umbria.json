Once the thriving domain of the Ur-Dwarves, an ancient race of master stonecrafters, this realm bore witness to their rise and eventual exodus. The Ur-Dwarves did not merely construct cities; they shaped the plane itself, blending their essence with Umbria\u2019s living stone. Their mastery allowed them to craft monumental cities that pulsed with the plane's lifeforce, leaving behind vast ruins that now stand as silent echoes of their greatness.<\/p><p>Over time, interplanar migrations brought the ancestors of orcs and goblins to Umbria, sparking a crucible of conflict. These newcomers clashed with the Ur-Dwarves, driven by competing ideologies and a struggle for control over the plane\u2019s unique resources. Ultimately, environmental shifts and unrelenting wars forced the Ur-Dwarves to abandon their homeland, seeking refuge in Khazad-Dorum, a realm attuned to stone and metal.<\/p><p>In the absence of the Ur-Dwarves, Umbria has transformed into a land where shadow and death dominate. Twilight-drenched plains stretch endlessly, interrupted by rivers of inky blackness and skeletal forests of gnarled, bioluminescent trees. The plane teems with lifeforms attuned to its shadowy essence, including Shadar-kai, specters, and creatures composed of living shadow. The ruins of the Ur-Dwarves remain scattered across the landscape, blending into the eerie ecology, some still pulsing faintly with their ancient magic.<\/p><p>Time flows erratically in Umbria, and shadows seem to possess an unnatural sentience. Explorers and adventurers are drawn to the plane, lured by its mysterious beauty and the tantalizing remnants of Ur-Dwarven magic. Yet, all who enter feel the weight of Umbria\u2019s deathly embrace\u2014a realm where the past lingers and the whispers of shadows shape its ever-evolving story.<\/p><p><\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-17T23:07:08.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T10:44:50.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
