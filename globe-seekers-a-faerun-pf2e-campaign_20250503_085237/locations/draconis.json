It's a realm of extremes: volcanoes erupt next to frozen tundras, wind-carved canyons border vast, shimmering oceans. But the true rulers of this chaotic landscape are the dragons.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Long before the chromatic and metallic dragons we know emerged<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, there existed their ancestors: the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Primordial Dragons<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. These beings were titans of pure elemental energy, embodying the raw power of Draconis. Their scales shimmered with the colours of fire, ice, lightning, earth, and water, and their roars could shake the very foundations of the plane.  They were wild and untamed, their actions shaping the very landscape of Draconis.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Over time, the Primordial Dragons began to change. The raw elemental energies within them coalesced, leading to the birth of distinct dragon types. Some, driven by a primal instinct for power and domination, became the first <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Chromatic Dragons<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  Others, embracing wisdom and balance, evolved into the first <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Metallic Dragons<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. This divergence marked the beginning of a long and tumultuous history.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The chromatic dragons, with their inherent hunger for power, quickly rose to dominance.  They forged a vast empire<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, their lairs filled with treasures plundered from across the planes. They warred amongst themselves for territory and control, their battles shaping the landscape of Draconis.  Their greed and lust for power led to the subjugation of other species, turning many into slaves or forcing them to flee to the furthest corners of the plane.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">But the seeds of rebellion were sown. The metallic dragons, disgusted by the tyranny of their kin, rallied under the banner of balance and justice.  They led a revolt that tore Draconis apart, a war that raged for centuries.  Volcanoes erupted, glaciers shattered, and the skies were darkened by the clash of elemental magic.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Finally, the metallic dragons, aided by those species who yearned for freedom, triumphed. The chromatic dragons were defeated and banished from Draconis. They fled through planar portals, seeking refuge on other planes, including the Material Plane<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The victorious metallic dragons established a new order, one based on harmony and respect for all life. They vowed to protect Draconis and prevent the chromatic dragons from ever reclaiming their lost dominion.  They knew that their banished kin would eventually seek to return and regain their lost power.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">And so, the metallic dragons began to venture beyond Draconis, following the trail of their chromatic brethren.  They journeyed to the Material Plane and other realms<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, becoming a force for good in the multiverse, fighting against the tyranny and destruction spread by the chromatic dragons.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">This is just one interpretation of how the dragon types could have originated and diverged. The sources provide a basic framework, but the specifics are left open to the imagination.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Life on Draconis: Beyond the Dragons<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">While dragons are the dominant species of Draconis, they are not the only inhabitants. The plane teems with life adapted to its harsh and ever-changing environment.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Dragonkin<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: Draconis is home to a variety of creatures related to dragons, such as <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">kobolds<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">wyvern<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, and <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">drake<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  These creatures often serve the more powerful dragons, acting as scouts, messengers, or even warriors in their armies.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Elemental Beings<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: The raw elemental energies of Draconis give rise to a plethora of elemental beings, such as <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">elementals<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"> and <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">genasi<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. These beings are often drawn to areas that reflect their specific elemental affinity, such as fire elementals congregating in volcanic regions.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Adaptable Fauna<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: The harsh conditions of Draconis have forced other creatures to adapt and evolve in unique ways. Giant, fire-breathing insects patrol the volcanic regions, while creatures with thick, icy hides roam the frozen tundras.  Strange, plant-like creatures that draw sustenance from the raw magical energy thrive in areas where different elemental energies converge.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Civilizations of Draconis<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Aside from the dragon lairs, which vary greatly in size and opulence, Draconis is home to several other civilizations:<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Obsidian Citadel<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: A fortress city carved from black volcanic rock, inhabited by a race of fire-resistant <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">dwarves<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. They are known for their mastery of metalworking, forging weapons and armour capable of withstanding even the most intense dragonfire. They trade with both metallic and chromatic dragons, maintaining a precarious neutrality in the ongoing conflict.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Windswept Aeries<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: A collection of interconnected floating islands, inhabited by a race of avian humanoids known as the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Kenku<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.  These creatures are skilled navigators and traders, utilising their ability to fly to travel between the different regions of Draconis.  They are often employed by dragons as spies and messengers.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The Crystal Labyrinth<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: A shimmering, ever-changing maze of crystal formations, inhabited by a race of sentient, crystalline beings. These creatures are masters of illusion and divination, using their connection to the plane's magical energy to see glimpses of the future and manipulate the perceptions of others.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Ecology of Draconis<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The ecosystem of Draconis is a delicate balance of elemental forces and the creatures that inhabit it.  The dragons, as apex predators, play a vital role in maintaining this balance.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Elemental Cycles<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: The constant clash and interplay of elemental energies on Draconis creates a dynamic environment where change is the only constant. Volcanoes erupt, giving way to fertile ash fields. Glaciers melt, forming vast, raging rivers.  These cycles ensure that no single element dominates the plane.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Dragon Influence<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: The actions of the dragons, particularly the chromatic ones, can have a significant impact on the environment.  A black dragon's acidic breath can transform a lush forest into a fetid swamp. A red dragon's fiery breath can trigger volcanic eruptions, reshaping the landscape.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"bullet normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"width:1.125rem;\">\u25cf<\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:1.25rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Survival of the Fittest<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">: Only the most adaptable creatures can survive on Draconis. The constant shifts in the environment, coupled with the threat of dragons, have led to the evolution of unique and resilient life forms.<\/span><\/div><p><\/p>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-17T23:07:08.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T10:45:11.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
