    "entry": "<h1>The Githzerai City of Zerthadlun</h1>\n\n<h2>Zerthadlun: A City in Limbo</h2>\n\n<p>Zerthadlun is a Githzerai city located in the plane of Limbo, known for its floating towers. Limbo is an incredibly dangerous plane filled with chaotic energy that causes damage upon contact. However, intelligent beings in Limbo can use their minds to manipulate this chaotic energy and carve out safe zones for themselves. Zerthadlun was likely created using this very principle of mental manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>The city boasts a renowned casino, the Nexus of Fortuna, where fortunes can shift dramatically. The Palazzo della Sicurezza, a significant location within Zerthadlun, serves as a meeting place where tasks are assigned, including missions against the Githyanki, the Githzerai's sworn enemies.  Within the city, one can find the Palazzo della Giustizia where individuals like Zetlana, the city's Mastromente, hold authority and dispense justice. It was here that a plot involving a Githyanki spy named Vrexxis, who owned the Nexus of Fortuna, was uncovered. This incident highlights the ongoing conflict between the Githzerai and Githyanki, even extending into the chaotic realm of Limbo.</p>\n\n<h2>Life in Zerthadlun</h2>\n\n<h3>Economy and Opportunities</h3>\n<p>Zerthadlun has a functioning economy with opportunities for acquiring property.  A character named Morun Tag purchased a property in Zerthadlun and built a portal connecting it to his manor in Procampur, a city on the Material Plane. Bounty hunting is a viable profession in Zerthadlun, as demonstrated by Korgak, who earned a million gold coins in ten days completing three significant bounties. The presence of dangerous creatures like Ancient Behirs and Abyssal Beholders indicates the inherent dangers of Limbo that extend even to a protected city like Zerthadlun.</p>\n\n<h3>Employment and Interplanar Connections</h3>\n<p>Zerthadlun possesses an Office of Job Placement that connects skilled individuals with employers from various planes of existence. B.B., known for his discretion and reliability, was offered positions ranging from bodyguard to an Archon of Mount Celestia to an elite trainer for a fire elemental city-state's defence force, showcasing the city's interplanar connections and the diverse opportunities available to its residents.</p>\n\n<h2>Githzerai Society</h2>\n\n<h3>Power and Dominance</h3>\n<p>The Githzerai of Zerthadlun are not uniformly welcoming. They value displays of power and dominance, as evidenced by their positive reaction to Vordekai's gruesome gift of Githyanki body parts.</p>\n\n<h3>Outcasts and Forbidden Knowledge</h3>\n<p>Despite their rigid society, Zerthadlun has its share of outcasts and those who pursue forbidden knowledge. The presence of a Githzerai alchemist working on weapons that could rapidly age Githyanki points to internal divisions and the pursuit of unconventional solutions.</p>\n\n<p>The sources portray Zerthadlun as a city of stark contrasts. It is a haven of order within the chaotic plane of Limbo, yet it harbors secrets and internal conflicts. While it offers opportunities for wealth and advancement, it is also a place where power and ruthlessness are highly valued.</p>",
