This empire, composed of the ancestors of the Aarakocra and Kenku<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, ruled the skies with an unparalleled mastery of wind, storm, and song. Their cities, constructed on colossal, perpetually mobile floating islands<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/p><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, drifted amidst the endless azure expanse, a testament to their ingenuity and harmonious existence with their environment.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Aetheria's geography is inherently unique<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. The plane consists of a limitless expanse of sky punctuated by these floating islands. The islands vary in size and climate, some harboring lush forests, others bearing jagged peaks, and still others resembling vast, windswept deserts. Perpetually raging storms and living lightning weave through the sky, creating a dynamic and often perilous environment<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. Aetheria's air currents, imbued with ethereal music, carry whispers of forgotten lore and the songs of the Skyborn, a constant reminder of their enduring legacy<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">During the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Age of Harmony<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, the Skyborn Empire thrived, its culture steeped in art, music, and reverence for the elements. Their mastery of air magic allowed them to manipulate the wind, ride the currents, and even command the storms to their will. Their society was structured around a council of elders, each representing a different aspect of their culture, such as song, craftsmanship, or weather manipulation.  The Kenku, revered for their perfect mimicry and storytelling abilities, served as chroniclers, preserving the Empire's history and passing down knowledge through generations. The Aarakocra, with their innate ability to fly and their prowess as warriors, patrolled the skies, defending the floating cities from external threats.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">However, this golden age was not destined to last. As the Skyborn Empire expanded, internal conflicts began to emerge. The Kenku, increasingly marginalized and yearning for a more prominent role, began to question the Aarakocra's dominance. Their mimicry, once a tool for preservation and entertainment, became a weapon, used to sow discord and manipulate the Aarakocra. This period, known as the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Age of Discord<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, saw the fracturing of the once-unified empire, with factions forming, alliances shifting, and whispers of rebellion echoing through the floating cities.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Great Storm<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, a cataclysmic event of unimaginable power, ultimately led to the Skyborn Empire's demise. Whether a natural phenomenon or a consequence of the Kenku's escalating manipulations, the Great Storm ravaged Aetheria, tearing apart the floating islands, scattering the Skyborn, and plunging the plane into chaos. The once-harmonious music of the air currents became distorted, filled with the echoes of destruction and the mournful cries of the fallen.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Aetheria's New Order<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">In the wake of the Great Storm, Aetheria entered the <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Age of Adaptation<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">. The surviving Skyborn, scattered and disoriented, were forced to adapt to their fractured world. Some sought refuge on the remaining floating islands, clinging to remnants of their culture, while others ventured into the dangerous, storm-ridden expanse, seeking new homes or simply survival.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Kenku, their voices stolen by a curse - possibly a consequence of their actions during the Age of Discord - retreated into the shadows, becoming solitary scavengers, their mimicry now a tool for survival rather than communication. The Aarakocra, still capable of flight but dispossessed of their once-grand cities, formed nomadic tribes, their mastery of the wind now crucial for navigating the treacherous skies.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">New inhabitants, drawn to Aetheria through planar rifts or seeking refuge from other realms, have added to the plane's diversity.  <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Air Genasi<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, beings of elemental air, navigate the storms with ease, their forms shifting and swirling with the wind. <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Giants<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, specifically Storm Giants and Cloud Giants<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, have established their own settlements on the larger floating islands, their immense size and strength offering them a measure of dominance in this turbulent environment.  <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Dragons<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, particularly Blue Dragons and Silver Dragons<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, patrol the skies, their powerful wings and breath weapons making them formidable predators.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Aetheria's ecology has also undergone a transformation. The once-lush forests and fertile plains have given way to a more rugged landscape, shaped by the constant storms and the influence of the Elemental Planes. The plane's resources are now more scattered and scarce, leading to competition and conflict among its inhabitants.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading3 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Whispers of the Past<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The Skyborn Empire may be gone, but its legacy persists in Aetheria.  <\/span><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Ruined cities<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, remnants of their floating islands, drift aimlessly, testaments to the Empire's former glory. These structures, some partially intact, others crumbling into dust, offer glimpses into the Skyborn's advanced technology and cultural achievements. Some are inhabited by the descendants of lesser Skyborn, while others hold forgotten knowledge and powerful artifacts, tempting adventurers and scholars from across the planes.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">Lingering magical phenomena<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, remnants of the Skyborn's mastery of air and storm magic, also shape Aetheria's environment.  Unpredictable wind patterns, swirling vortexes, and localised storms, sometimes infused with the haunting melodies of the Skyborn's songs, create both challenges and opportunities for the plane's inhabitants. These phenomena are a constant reminder of the Skyborn's power and their enduring impact on the plane, even in their absence.<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"bold ng-star-inserted\">The remnants of the Skyborn Empire<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">, both physical and ethereal, continue to shape Aetheria's present and influence its future. They offer a glimpse into a bygone era of grandeur and a reminder of the potential for both harmony and destruction that resides within the forces of nature.  Aetheria, now a realm of adaptation and survival, stands as a testament to the cyclical nature of civilizations, the enduring power of legacy, and the constant struggle for balance in a world shaped by elemental forces and the echoes of the past.<\/span><\/div>","is_private":0,"tooltip":null,"is_template":null,"is_attributes_private":0,"focus_x":null,"focus_y":null,"created_at":"2024-11-17T23:07:07.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-11-18T10:43:49.000000Z","created_by":275646,"updated_by":275646,"image_path":null,"image_uuid":null,"header_image":null,"header_uuid":null,"marketplace_uuid":null}}
