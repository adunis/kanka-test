It is described as the only place on the Material Plane where deities can manifest in their true forms, rather than through avatars. Additionally, it is the sole location where a mortal being can ascend to godhood.<\/span><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\"><\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph heading2 ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">Location and Access<\/span><\/div><div class=\"paragraph normal ng-star-inserted\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;\"><span class=\"ng-star-inserted\">The precise location of the Heavently Staircase is shrouded in secrecy.

A powerful Aboleth known as the Patron seeks to exploit the site's unique properties to achieve his own ascension to godhood.
